	<p> 
		The ogres were a group whose how was attacke and destroyed. They intially intended to take over the town of Tempest
		which lead to a clash with Rimuru. After the fight Rimuru agreed to take in the ogres who had just attacked him because he 
		has a weakness to telling anyone in need no. Once the ogres are named by Rimuru the undergo an evolution from Ogres to Ogre Mages.
		This gives them a more human look and vastly increased their power. Due to helping them when they were in a time of need the ogres 
		swore their alleigences to Rimuru for the rest of their lives
