	<p>
		Upon escaing from the mysterious cave Rimuru discoverd a town of goblins who are human like, yet did not have much. With not much 
		defense they asked Rimuru to help protect them from attacks which hesitantly agreed. He helped them set up a fence around town and setup
		 some traps. Later that day the village as attacked by Direwolves. They are caught in the premade traps which leads to Rimuru beheading their
		 leader and telling them to run for it. This was a bluff to scare of the rest of the wolves but, had the opposite effect. Once tge leader was 
		 killed The wolves swore algiences to Rimuru and began to live together in the goblin town. The Goblins and direwolves from here on out were 
		 partnered together and formed teams known as the Goblin Riders. Once Rimuru named the gobline they evolved from Goblins to Hobogoblins. This gave
		 them increased strength and for older memeber they regained their youth. One Direwolf was name <bold> Ragna </bold> and he evolved into a Tempest
		 Wolf. Since Ragna was the new leader of the direwolves anyonw under him also evolved into Tempest wolves
